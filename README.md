## Problems:
* Setting up frustrum and lookat properly

## To-Do:

### Networking
* Network two players
* Set player 1 as master, player 2 as slave
* Grab enemy coordinates from partner and update
* Send ball coordinates from master to slave, update slave

### OpenGL
* Create 3D objects for paddles
* Create 3D environment (walls and grid)
* Implement shaders? (not necessary but would look a lot better)
